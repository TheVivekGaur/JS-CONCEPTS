// //function statement also known as function decalaraiton.
// function a(){
//  console.log('a called')
// }
// //function expression

// //diff - function expression hosting sucks during hoisting phase a has created a memory and this function a is assigned to it
// //but in case of b it has been assigned with value undefind unitl code is executed
// var b = function (){
// console.log('b called')
// }
// a();
// b();

// //Anoynmous functions they doesnot have own identity they are used in place where  function used as values;

// //Named function expression

// var c = function x(){  //you are giving name to function too in a variable but you can access it in function scope only not globally
 
// }

// //difference b/w parameters and arguments
// //params used in scope of function only not outside and arguments passed when we pass values to a fucntion
// //params are those who gets value and arguments are those we pass values at ccalling time function

// //First class function
// //function can be passed inside a function as a argument as function givs value
// //we can return a function from a function
// //the ability of functions to be used as values and can be passed as an agument ot another fucntion is first xclassa
